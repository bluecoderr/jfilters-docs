### Generating Filters
The component will, auto-generate the filters and set them as unpublished by default.

In case you wonder why you see some filters more than once. 
It is because it generates a filter for each installed language, in case Joomla is setup as multi-lingual.

### Publish Filters
Publish the filters you want to use in the front-end and we are almost ready to go.
