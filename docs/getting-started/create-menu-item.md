title: Create a menu item for the results
---

Go to `Menus` select your menu and press the "New" button.

As "Menu Item Type" select `JFilters > Results`.

:::tip
We do NOT want this menu item to be directly accessible by the users.  
Our suggestion is to put it under a menu, which is not visible in the front-end.
:::

As *Alias*, we suggest setting something that is relevant to your content.  
e.g. If the site (or the used filters) are about wines, you can set *'wines'* as alias. 

We will explain the settings under the **Options** tab, as the other are common settings for all the menu items in Joomla.

##  Primary Filter
If a primary filter is selected, that filter will use as an alias, that menu item's alias.
That means that the urls will be shorter and more specific to the site's content.

:::info
only [root filters](/component/filter-config/filter#root) can be used as *Primary Filters*.
:::


**The following settings regard the results and exist also in the Smart Search's menu item**
## Result Taxonomy
Shows meta-data like: *type*, *author*, *category* and *language* to the result items.

## Result Description
Shows a short description to the result items.

## Description Length
Length of the *Result Description*.

##  Result Date
The creation date of the result item (e.g. an article).

##  Result URL
The url of the result item.
